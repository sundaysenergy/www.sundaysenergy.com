## CSS Sub-page Code for Drupal Themes

$365.00
CSS for Drupal 6.1.1 required. This package is for each additional page design that needs to be themed into drupal. The most common example is when the front page or custom content template/layout (contemplate) pages that are different from the rest of the site. 4.1.3 Page Design, example html/css site, or an approved psd, pdf, ai or other image file is required before the page can be coded in. Often a wireframe is required is define the various aspects of the page.

## View Creation

$95.00
A creation of one view using the Drupal views module. An additional $15.00 fee will be applied (for the installation and configuration) if the views module http://drupal.org/project/views and/or views bonus pack http://drupal.org/project/views_bonus modules are not installed or if it the modules need to be updated. This price does not include custom arguments that may be necessary for the view to function correctly. Each custom argument is usually $65. The view is saved into a feature.

The views module provides a flexible method for Drupal sitedesigners to control how lists of content (nodes) are presented.Traditionally, Drupal has hard-coded most of this, particularly in howtaxonomy and tracker lists are formatted.

This tool is essentially a smart query builder that, given enoughinformation, can build the proper query, execute it, and display the results. It has four modes, plus a special mode, and provides an impressive amount of functionality from these modes.

You need Views if:

You like the default front page view, but you find you want to sort it differently.
You like the default taxonomy/term view, but you find you want to sort it differently; for example, alphabetically.
You use /tracker, but you want to restrict it to posts of a certain type.
You like the idea of the 'article' module, but it doesn't display articles the way you like.
You want a way to display a block with the 5 most recent posts of some particular type.
You want to provide 'unread forum posts'.
You want a monthly archive similar to the typical Movable	Type/Wordpress archives that displays a link to the in the form of	"Month, YYYY (X)" where X is the number of posts that month, and	displays them in a block. The links lead to a simple list of posts for	that month.
Views can do a lot more than that, but those are some of the obvious uses of Views.
