The Drupal hosting stack consists of many layers. Firewalls, load balancer, front-end cache, PHP Opt-Code caching, performance optimized versions of PHP, MySQL, and Drupal. Drupal software runs on redundant servers that use a hybrid of Solid State drives (SSD) and 15K RPM SAS drives. The database runs on pure SSDs.
