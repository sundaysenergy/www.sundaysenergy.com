## DNS Hosting Upgrade & Server Setting Requirements

Sundays Energy has started working with Dynect to provide our hosting clients with improved DNS service. This allows us to provide a great DNS solution, and is the same service used by many enterprise level websites, including Twitter.

This means the probability of your site going down because of DNS issues is virtually zero. The system has not had any service downtime since it started in 2001. It also gives us the control we need to correctly point your domain to our various servers as it moves through our system.

We include this service for all accounts that host with us. The switch requires the DNS address settings be changed at your domain name registrar.

Going forward, they should be pointed to:
ns1.p09.dynect.net
ns2.p09.dynect.net
ns3.p09.dynect.net
ns4.p09.dynect.net

It's an easy change once you find the place to make it. It can be tricky navigating some domain name registration websites. Please let us know if you have any questions. Also, if you can send us a quick e-mail when you've made the change, that would be most appreciated.
