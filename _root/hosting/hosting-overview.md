### Overview

Our servers are completely under our control, which ensures reliability (including running scripts for problem identification 24-hours a day). For server administration, SE uses client accessible software such as cPanel & WebHost Manager; proven platforms which allow us the most constant vigilance over our client websites. SE does not employ any kind of automated, unmonitored sign-up, which could be open to the public (and spammers). SE has a policy of not overselling server space, and we do not allow abuse of the CPU and other system resources. SE will continually review every hosted account, guaranteeing that a Client’s website will be in good company as it joins the world wide web.

### Infrastructure

Our machines are clustered, Linux OS physical hardware servers with two or more 64 Bit processors/ cores, 4GB of ECC DDR Ram, Hardware RAID 5 10,000RPM storage devices. With RAID 5 one drive can fail without any data being lost. Protection against a natural disaster or multiple drive failure is implemented using an off-site “live mirror” of the entire hosting account that maintains less than a 30- minute delay. Both datacenters house the equipment in server vaults.

All account urls will point to a single IP. All www traffic is routed through a Reverse Proxy load balancer and then sent to 1 or more PHP server where dynamic functionality is performed. Each PHP server has access to a dedicated MySQL database server. We do not put the database on the same server as PHP. User sessions are stored in the database so the user does not notice that the PHP server changes.

### Connectivity

The primary SE hardware cluster is hosted in a SAS70 Type II audited datacenter in downtown St Paul. Our managed router sits atop three Tier 1 Networks (GBLX, L3, UUNET) in addition to the Transit-Free Cogent and XO networks (basically Tier 1 accept when connecting to the Sprint network). Each server connection is 100mbit or greater. Routing is based on fewest hops, not lowest cost.

### Support

Support regarding network or server availability is included. This package allows for unlimited hosting specific tech support via email 24-7 and limited phone support. We will try to help you with your 3rd party domain names but can not ensure issue resolution for issues regarding products and services not under the control of Sundays Energy.
Hosting does not include shell access (available on request) or cPanel add-ons. SE reserves the right to suspend and refund any hosting account (after warning) at any time that the account is in violation of the service agreement.

### Level of Service & Uptime Guarantee

Sundays Energy is dedicated to providing our hosting clients with enterprise class service. We back our uptime promise with a 100% uptime guarantee.

If your web site, database, email, or SFTP is unusable as a result of a failure in our systems and for reasons other than previously announced scheduled maintenance, coding or configuration errors, we'll credit your next invoice with 1 month hosting for each 1 hour cumulative service interruption in a month. We begin assessing credit from the time you open a support ticket, send us an email, or call to report the problem. Service interruptions are confirmed via an independent third party tool that runs tests from 7 locations across the globe. We end assessing credit when the service(s) are confirmed available in all 7 locations.

For clients with mission critical web applications absolute uptime is required. Sundays Energy hosting provides the option to have hosting clones in geographically dispersed data centers. Traffic to the website is balanced over two or more locations. Should one location fail all traffic is routed to the remaining server(s). Have your site hosted from different states or even different countries.
