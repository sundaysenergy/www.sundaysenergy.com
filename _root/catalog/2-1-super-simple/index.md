Includes DNS hosting.

We will host your static site on an enterprise level Content Delivery Network (CDN) and use the worlds best Domain Name Servers (DNS) to keep your domain pointing the right places.

All HTML, images, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript files. Files are delivered from a server closest to the website visitor. Akamai delivers between 15-30% of all web traffic, leveraging over 73,000 servers in 70 countries within nearly 1,000 networks. Approximately 85% of the world’s Internet users are within a single “network hop” of an Akamai server.

To keep sites fast, we push all the site assets to a global Content Delivery Network. This is for things like images, cascading style sheets, and JavaScript files. It keeps the site load times fast because these files are delivered from a server closest to the website visitor. We require a minimum of a 15 minute lifetime for files hosted on the CDN. We also have purpose-built static file servers that mirror the CDN but update in less than a minute after your changes are retrieved from dropbox.

Files are managed using your Dropbox account. This allows you to edit the files on your computer, and when saved they automatically get synced to your website.
