## Google Apps Email Hosting

We used to do email hosting. But for the past few years we have been moving clients to a version of Google Apps that's tied to your domain.

Google provides an excellent free service for up to 10 email addresses. This includes great spam filtering, a nice online web interface, huge storage capacity (over 10GB), and all the options of Google Apps (such as spreadsheets, document sharing, etc.). Of course, it's also extremely reliable and effectively prevents any email issues. Furthermore, it's free for up to 10 email addresses. It's a service we couldn't compete with, so we started recommending it and switching clients to it.

Google allows this to all happen independently of Sundays Energy servers and infrastructure. Since we're focusing more exclusively on Drupal development and web hosting, it makes sense for us too.

The one drawback is it's a bit of a pain to setup and configure. It's possible to do yourself by visiting [Google Apps Signup](http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new)
Alternatively, we can set it up and configure it for $99.

## Sundays Energy Google Apps Setup Service

1. We create a free Google Apps setup with E-mail for both websites
2. We remake all your current e-mail accounts in the new account.
3. We send you the new login details, and you're ready to go!

Be aware that we won't transfer e-mails currently in your webmail accounts. If you want or need that emails transfered it is $49 per email account. If you're syncing a computer-based program (like Outlook) to your email, you'll still have the old e-mails on your computer.
