## Options for Importing Your Drupal 5 Site(s)

The good news is that we specialize in helping keep Drupal sites running. We have a few options for you.

The short answer is, for $199 we will move your site onto our servers. The price includes moving the site and four months of standard hosting. We will require some additional action be taken, mainly applying updates. You will not have to worry about using too many resources and we **will not** turn your site off unless it's been compromised and/or is serving illegal materials.

Your site is running Drupal 5.x, which was current in 2009. In the time since your site was developed, Drupal 5 is no longer an active platform. You can see the official "End of Life Announcement" (made January 11th, 2011) here: http://drupal.org/node/1027214

In addition, Drupal 5 only runs on server software (PHP 5.2) which was current at that time. Unfortunately that has also been discontinued and is no longer supported by the community that developed it. Regardless of where you host, or how many resources your site uses, running Drupal 5 presents 3 problems going forward:

1. **Website security.** There are enough Drupal 5 sites still around that online attackers may find it worth their time to hack or otherwise take advantage of. Since Drupal 5 is no longer maintained, there will be no security fixes for new cracks. This leaves your site vulnerable and can contribute to performance problems.
1. **Hosting concerns.** As a web hosting provider, we need to update our servers to remain current for efficiency and security. And Drupal 5 is not compatible with current hosting software. PHP 5.2 was last updated January of 2011. Going forward Sunday Energy (and other hosting providers) will need to create special server setups that specifically run the older software. Since fewer and fewer Drupal 5 sites are being hosted the expense of keeping infrastructure to support it is shared by fewer users and thusly the price will increase over time.
1. **Maintenance and improvements.** It is difficult to maintain and provide support for technology that we and other developers don’t work on anymore. Any issues or feature enhancements take extra time to perform, and they do not carry forward (without extra work) once a site is updated beyond Drupal 5.

## Your options

### Keep it Drupal

The easiest solution is for us to move your site to our servers. We have our own custom-built server infrastructure specific to hosting Drupal. Drupal sites can consume a lot of resources and often run into problems on generalized hosting platforms. We only do Drupal performance hosting. Our systems are built from the ground up to be able to handle the demands in an intelligent way. You will not have to worry about using too many resources and we won't turn your site off unless it's been compromised or is serving illegal materials. Almost always it costs less to host on our servers than it does to pay us to figure out why it's slow, or using too much CPU on your current server.

*Required Actions*

Because it is increasingly difficult for us to provide Drupal 5 hosting, some action will need to be taken. The 2 options we can offer are:

1. After moving to our servers we’ll upgrade you to the latest version of Drupal 5 for a small fee which we’ll provide a separate quote for. In our experience the cost is between $100-300. You will then remain on our Drupal 5, PHP 5.2 legacy server.  Six months after moving to our servers you can continue hosting your Drupal 5 site for a monthly fee of $25/month.
1. We can upgrade your site directly to Drupal 7. In this case, we'll also provide you a quote for this after we are able to review your site.


### Not keeping it Drupal

If your site doesn't get updated much we can take a snapshot of the site and serve the site as a "static" site. This is commonly used for sites that haven't been updated in several years but the site owners want to keep the site online. This eliminates expenses related to keeping a Drupal site hosted and updated. In this case we would take the snapshot during the move to our servers. Instead of 4 months of hosting we include 1 full year. Going forward the price to host the static site is just $60 per year. Editing content is more difficult with this option. All forms on your site will stop working. Contact and other web forms will no longer work. All updates happen through FTP or through a web interface that allows you to edit html text files.

## In summary

1. Move the site to our servers $149 and upgrade to the latest Drupal 5 for $100-300. Every $100 is service includes two months of standard hosting.
1. Migrate the site directly to Drupal 7. We'd provide a quote for that after moving it to our servers.
1. Archive the site and make it static (no Drupal login or admin interface). $149 includes the archive process and hosting for a full year. $60 per year ($5/mo) to continue hosting it.
