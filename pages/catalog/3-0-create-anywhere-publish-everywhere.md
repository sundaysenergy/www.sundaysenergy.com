## Create Anywhere Publish Everywhere

**"Anywhere"** is a content feed or repository. A content repository is anything that contains a set of content. Examples are Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, markdown files in your Dropbox, even Drupal or Wordpress sites.

**"Everywhere"** is focused on personalized/custom website hosted on supersimple, but could really be anythingâ€¦ No more web "pages". Just content "views". All content is exposed in a read-only "API" making it available to any device that can consume it.

CAPE integrates seamlessly with the SuperSimple static site hosting platform. This allows you to have a dynamically created site that is served statically. This means that site hosting is not included in the CAPE price.
