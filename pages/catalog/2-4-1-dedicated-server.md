Access your hosting files using dropbox.

Generate a website from a folder of plain text files. Each text file represents a page on the site. These files can contain plaintext, [markdown](), or html code - whichever format you wish to work in.

Files are managed using your Dropbox account. This allows you to  edit the files on your computer, and when saved they automatically get synced to your website.
