The fastest and most reliable DNS hosting in the world. Up to 100,000 DNS queries per month.

DNS hosting is an undervalued service that serves the sole function of pointing your custom domain names to various servers on the internet. There are many free services available, but you get what you pay for. Low cost services often cause problems at the most inconvenient times, and then the web host usually gets blamed. "Hey, my website is down. You are hosting my site, fix it." Well, it might be that your domain name isn't properly sending traffic to the right places.

It's just not worth it for us to answer those phone calls and emails for something that isn't in our control. For that reason, we have standardized on using the fastest, most reliable DNS service in the industry. It's called Dyn, and is the same setvice used by sites like Amazon and Twitter. In the 11 years Dyn has been in business, they have not had any downtime. That's a mammoth statement for any web service. This is technically an optional service since you could choose to manage your DNS elsewhere, but we would not be able to guarantee your site's availability if you did.
