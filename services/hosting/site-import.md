## Site Import

We can import Drupal 5, 6, or 7 sites. You will need to provide us with as many access credentials as possible including FTP, cPanel, and SSH if possible.

### Import from an archive you provide
$149.00
With this service Sundays Energy will import one site hosted elsewhere to the Sundays Energy Aegir hosting system. It requires an archive of drupal code and files and a database dump file. The archive needs to be uploaded to our servers or it can be accessible via http, ftp, or ssh. Includes 2 months of standard hosting or 1 month of commerce hosting.

### Import raw site via FTP and Drupal

$199.00
We will help you extract the files and database from a site currently hosted on another service provider. In addition to the usernames and passwords requested above we will need a Drupal admin login. Includes 4 months of standard hosting or 2 months of commerce hosting.

### Create a static version of an existing site

$199.00
If your site doesn't get updated much we can take a snapshot of the site and serve the site as a "static" site. This is commonly used for sites that haven't been updated in several years but the site owners want to keep the site online. This eliminates expenses related to keeping a Drupal site hosted and updated. In this case we would take the snapshot as it is currently and upload the snapshot to our static server infrastructure. Instead of 4 months of hosting we include 1 full year. Going forward the price to host the static site is just $40 per year or $50 per year with a domain name registration. Editing content is more difficult with this option. All forms on your site will stop working. Contact and other web forms will no longer work. All updates happen through FTP or through a web interface that allows you to edit html text files.
