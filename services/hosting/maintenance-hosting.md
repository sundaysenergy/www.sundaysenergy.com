## Recommended Hosting for Drupal Maintenance Accounts

Maintaining Drupal sites hosted on other servers is almost always inconvenient and consumes unnecessary time. This is because the development process would likely be on our servers while the live site remains on your current host. In some cases this is possible, but rarely is it cost effective. To have a great system for updating and working with changes, we prefer to have both the live and development sites on the same hosting platform.

Since your host likely works with all types of websites, they are not designed for the unique requirements of Drupal. Moving to a host that specializes in only Drupal websites helps with many things (and doesn't cost that much more). One of the management software tools we use is the [Aegir system](http://www.aegirproject.org). It helps coordinate development and site upgrades. Almost all sites load much faster than before simply because of switching the type of hosting.

To further incentivize using Aegir and our preferred hosting environment, we have implemented a new pricing structure that rewards clients for hosting in this way. Since it helps us work in the most efficient and correct way, we give a discount on hosting to clients that use both our maintenance and hosting services.  For e-commerce websites, we give 1 month of free web hosting for every $100 in Drupal update services we provide.

This means that if you switch to Sundays Energy Aegir hosting you will get 1 month of hosting for every $100 in Drupal maintenance up to 1 year in the future. For example, if you have us perform $900 worth of Drupal updates we will credit you 9 months of hosting.

If you have a philosophical problem with using the same company for hosting and development, we recommend [Omega8](http://omega8.cc).  They provide the same infrastructure software stack that we do. Their prices are $56/mo or $408/yr. In many cases issues will have to be sent to Omega8 since we do not have full access to the servers they use. This can result in longer times to fix some issues but does provide diversity in your technology partners.
