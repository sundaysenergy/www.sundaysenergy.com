Includes one month of DNS hosting and Drupal hosting for sites with up to 10 enabled modules.

Drupal requires constant maintenance. Added features, security fixes, and performance improvements are the norm and happen almost weekly. Site owners very rarely want to be involved with the hassle of creating a development site, putting all the updated code on the development site, testing, and then migrating the live site to the updated code base. For that reason we charge per enabled module. The base package includes 10 modules. Additional modules start at just $1/mo each.

We will apply security, feature, and performance updates as needed.

The Drupal hosting stack consists of many layers. Firewalls, load balancer, front-end cache, PHP Opt-Code caching, performance optimized versions of PHP, MySQL, and Drupal. Combined with a control panel for managing installations, the site software runs on redundant servers that use a hybrid of Solid State drives (SSD) and 15K RPM SAS drives.

E-commerce hosting requires the additional purchase of 2.5.3.
